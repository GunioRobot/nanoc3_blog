%p This is an example of a nanoc3 blog.

%p To get started, consider replacing this default homepage with your own customized homepage. Some pointers on how to do so:
%ul
  %li
    %p
      %strong Change this page's content 
      by editing 
      %code content/index.haml
      \. This is the actual page content, and therefore doesnâ€™t include the header, sidebar or style information (those are part of the layout).
  %li
    %p
      %strong Change the layout
      by editing 
      %code layouts/default.haml
      , and create something unique (and hopefully less bland).
