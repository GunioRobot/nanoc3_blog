  About Mario Gutierrez
  
%p I have developed and designed about everything. My experience  includes real-time coding in 8051 Assembly/C/C++  through higher level GUI/Web development in Delphi, Visual Basic, Java, C#/ASP.NET and ActionScript. Currently I am focused on Ruby, Objective-C and Java/Scala. I have also been told I am a decent designer (Photoshop, Flash and CSS).  have won awards on DeviantArt if that counts :)

%p I strongly believe the future is in smart devices and connecting them to web services. While I have been .NET developer for the longest time, I think MS is losing the battle. IE is quickly losing ground. Who cares about WinMobile? The web is so important and Microsoft continues to put money in projects it cannot win like Bing instead of improving Internet Explorer and making .NET a first class citizen on other platforms. 

%p I am focused on open-source technologies around Ruby on Rails/Sinatra, iPhone/Android and MongoDB.
