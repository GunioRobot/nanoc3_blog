excerpt: Why I became disinterested in a well paying enterprise position.
---

I have been in a rut the last several years, grinding in enterprise shops creating and maintaining the same kind of applications over and over. The people I worked with were great, but the intellectual challenges of programming were missing. I am a creative problem solver. That is what good developers/architects are. It is easy to become disinterested without a challenge. Work was work and that is not a good thing. 

Change was inevitable. I had to get out on my own to be happy. That means innovating not imitating. Some say this is not a good time to branch out. Is life about money? Success comes to those who are passionate about their craft.
