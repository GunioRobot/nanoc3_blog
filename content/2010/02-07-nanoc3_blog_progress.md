[nanoc3_blog](http://nanoc3-blog.mgutz.com) is my first Ruby open source project.
`nanoc3_blog` is a static blog starter kit which generates this site. It is
the basic infrastructure for a minimalist blog.

I plan to enhance my blog with jQuery effects. I may not merge the effects
back into the `nanoc3_blog` project however. The starter kit should remain simple.

I have mixed feelings about DISQUS. In general, the service is great. 
However, DISQUS' javascript loading and processing intermittently affects the rendering of pages. 
In addition, the comment section below overpowers content
with unnecessary design elements and options. Why not have a style which uses
standard controls and a simpler form? I'm DISQUSTED. OK, the styling
is not too bad. I have a feeling `display:none` will be used generously in a custom stylesheet.
