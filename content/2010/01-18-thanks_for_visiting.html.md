Thanks to everyone in the [nanoc3 group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc)
for the sample code. Thanks to the author of nanoc3, [Denis Defreyne](http://stoneship.org/about/).

I tried other compilers and chose nanoc3 for its architecture.
Look at these [contenders](http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation.html).
