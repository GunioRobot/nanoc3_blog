## Thanks

  Thanks to everyone in the 
  [nanoc group](http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc)
  for sample code.
  
  Thanks to [Denis Defreyne](http://stoneship.org/about/), author of nanoc.

  I tried [other compilers](http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/static_website_generation.html)
  and chose nanoc3 for its architecture.
